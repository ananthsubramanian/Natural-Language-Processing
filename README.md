# Natural-Language-Processing

This repository has all my Natural Language Processing Assignments along with the iPython notebooks. 

Assignment 1:
This talks about using nltk package within python to download text books and calaculate lexical diversity. Lexical diversity is the ratio of unique number of words to the total number of words in a text.

The takeaway from this assignment is to argue whether vocabulary size and lexical diversity in combination could be a better measure of text difficulty (or reading level). We compare texts at different grade levels. The html file and code are available.
