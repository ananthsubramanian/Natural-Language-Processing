# Natural-Language-Processing

This repository has all my Natural Language Processing projects along with the iPython notebooks. 

Project 1:
This talks about using nltk package within python to download text books and calaculate lexical diversity. Lexical diversity is the ratio of unique number of words to the total number of words in a text.

The takeaway from this assignment is to understand whether vocabulary size and lexical diversity in combination could be a better measure of text difficulty (or reading level). We compare texts at different grade levels. The html file and code are available. 

Project 2:
This project involves reading text of different grades (3, 5, 6) and calculating the lexical diversity.

Project 3:
1.Use Levenshtein package to calculate similarity percentage
2. PotterStemmer to convert a word to its root word (ex. running to run)

Project 3:
Analyze different Part of Speech (POS) tagger

Project 4:
Calculate word similarity using different methods

Project 5:
Analyze ELMO and Spacy packages

Project 6:
Use RandomForestClassifer and NN to distinguish between Music and Direction
